1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I used Express and NodeJS for this project. I am already familiar with NodeJS and Express. I find it easy to use and quick to get started. NodeJS is 
fast, scalable and has a vast package ecosystem. Express is minimalistic and lightweight and is quick and easy to create a small project with.

2) What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
My solution is robust and validates and sanitizes inpts to prevent incorrect parameters from being passed in via requests.
however, it requires a sort every time a user spends points. It also does not persist any data to disk.

3)  What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
My favourite school project so far was designing and implementing a 4 staged RISC V processor.
It was challenging to figure out  how data flows between the different stages and interact with previous stages during hazard detection.
